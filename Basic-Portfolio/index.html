            <p>It's not enough, but it's helping. In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the
                overthrow of a democratically-elected Iranian government.

                For some, nagging questions remain. Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength." Yes, government
                must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more
                efficient. That experience guides my conviction that partnership between America and Islam must be based on
                what Islam is, not what it isn't. There is so much fear, so much mistrust.

                Farmers and scholars; statesmen and patriots who had traveled across an ocean to escape tyranny and
                persecution finally made real their declaration of independence at a Philadelphia convention that lasted
                through the spring of 1787.
