            <p>Saludos, My name is Eric Magallan. I'm a senior graphic designer and aspiring full-stack web development
                student. I've always been interested in emerging technologies and enjoy throwing myself into the
                deep-end when it comes to learning. Most recently, I completed an 8 month internship at NASA's Johnson
                Space Center in Houston, Texas where I provided support to the Hybrid Reality Lab by assisting in
                developing simulation software that could be used to train astronauts in virtual reality and evaluate
                engineering analysis. I hope to either land a career at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
                CA or start my own digital marketing agency empire with my wife. Did I mention I was ambitions? ;)
            </p>
