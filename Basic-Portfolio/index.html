        <p>It's not enough, but it's helping. In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the
            overthrow of a democratically-elected Iranian government.

            For some, nagging questions remain. Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength." Yes, government
            must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more
            efficient. That experience guides my conviction that partnership between America and Islam must be based on
            what Islam is, not what it isn't. There is so much fear, so much mistrust.

            Farmers and scholars; statesmen and patriots who had traveled across an ocean to escape tyranny and
            persecution finally made real their declaration of independence at a Philadelphia convention that lasted
            through the spring of 1787. I chose to run for the presidency at this moment in history because I believe
            deeply that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together - unless we perfect
            our union by understanding that we may have different stories, but we hold common hopes; that we may not
            look the same and we may not have come from the same place, but we all want to move in the same direction -
            towards a better future for of children and our grandchildren. Legalized discrimination - where blacks were
            prevented, often through violence, from owning property, or loans were not granted to African-American
            business owners, or black homeowners could not access FHA mortgages, or blacks were excluded from unions,
            or the police force, or fire departments - meant that black families could not amass any meaningful wealth
            to bequeath to future generations. I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming.
